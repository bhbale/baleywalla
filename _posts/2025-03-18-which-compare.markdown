### Problem

With a leaky bucket issue within the subscription side of the business, our squad was tasked with how we could better retain members. A fundamental step in the research and buying journey is the ability to compare products at a glance. At the time, we weren't doing a good enough job in this area for members. 

As a squad, we identified 'compare' as a big opportunity to focus on where we could improve journeys for users and increase member engagement.

### Research

We already knew a lot about of the research and buying journey process through previous research but we didn’t know how our current compare journey was performing for users apart from our own assumptions and frustrations with the experience.

As a squad, we undertook 2 rounds of research to uncover insights and pain points by showing our current experience and new designs in front of participants on UserTesting.

This included a new mobile concept for the compare journey which we decided was a no-brainer to test as an opportunity because for whatever reason, the compare tool was never available to over 50% of our users.

### Opportunities

Using all the insights from the research, we came together as a squad to come up with ideas on how we could tackle the more pressing areas of concern for users. 

We then further validated these ideas through A/B test experiments and where necessary, evaluative research. We were continuously learning through research and experiments using both qualitative and quantitive data points to ensure that any new designs were meeting both user needs and increasing engagement metrics respectively.

### A number of solutions (big and small)

We delivered and shipped a number of initiatives across multiple quarters after validating each one. It was important to ship each initiative quickly in order to get real data that is experienced by 100% of our users. This is also to reward all the efforts by the squad and to see the the work flourish impactfully.

Here's a list of all the initiatives we released to users:
- Ability to compare on mobile
- Reducing the size of product cards on listing pages
- Compare functionality on article pages
- Compare on the saved page after shortlisting products
- Enhancements to the compare page

### Impact

As a squad, we delivered a series of initiatives across multiple quarters that had incremental impact on compare throughout the year. To our surprise, we saw a 33% YoY increase in engagement on the compare journey as a result of all the changes.

By using user insight and connecting the work to business goals, our squad managed to tell a story of how essential it is to understand the research and buying journey of our users and how we can use these insights to push this kind of work forward that also aligns with business goals.
