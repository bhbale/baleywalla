### Summary

Focus on diversifying revenue outside of subscriptions → Affiliates seemed logical as it was in our remit → We tested a few good ideas → These ideas translated to an estimated £100k additional revenue per year

- My role
- Leading design within a product trio
- Planning and facilitating ideation sessions
- Competitor and affiliate business research
- Planning and writing A/B test plans
- Working closely with experimentation, data, and engineering teams

### Problem

After migrating key product review pages (consisting of listing, product, and compare templates), we could finally look to improve these pages for our users. At the time, the problem within the business was that subscriptions were dwindling and we coudn't rely on subscriptions alone.

As a squad, we looked to focus on affiliates to diversify revenue for the business. We just migrated ‘where to buy’ components on these key pages but not much had changed which put us in a good position to explore opportunities to optimise the affiliate journey and how we presented retailer links to users.

### Research

Is their any? Include competitor analysis? Stage in the research and buying journey that includes price and explain that it's out of our control if users choose to exclusively check prices on Which? or to check other sources which is another insight. 

A key insight is showing one or two retailers isn't enough for users. This is dependent on our tech being able to show more retailers so again, out of our control.

What do we have in control? The journeys to retailers, how we style pricing and retailers, and the components we own.

### Opportunities

Lots from an ideation workshop where we got everyone to show an example of how others are doing a good job of affiliate links.
