### Summary

Focus on diversifying revenue outside of subscriptions → Affiliates seemed logical as it was in our remit → We tested a few good ideas → These ideas translated to an estimated £100k additional revenue per year

- My role
- Leading design within a product trio
- Planning and facilitating ideation sessions
- Competitor and affiliate business research
- Planning and writing A/B test plans
- Working closely with experimentation, data, and engineering teams

### Problem

After migrating key product review pages (consisting of listing, product, and compare templates), we could finally look to improve these pages for our users. At the time, the problem within the business was that subscriptions were dwindling and we coudn't rely on them alone.

As a squad, we looked to focus on affiliates to diversify revenue for the business. We just migrated ‘where to buy’ components on these key pages but not much had changed which put us in a good position to explore opportunities to optimise the affiliate journey and how we presented retailer links to users.

     <figcaption>The starting point - we had 'View retailers' links on product cards on various pages that would go to the product page  and anchor down to the 'Where to buy' accordion which was collapsed by default and near the bottom of the page</figcaption>

### Insights

From the research and buying journey, we already knew that users need to feel confident that they've found the best price before purchasing a product.

A running theme from previous research was that when users are given the option of only 1 or 2 retailers, this isn't enough for them to use our affiliate links. It's normal behaviour for users to look elsewhere i.e. Google Shopping to find more available retailers and pricing. We couldn't force users to click our affiliate links which made this very constraining in what we could do.

What could we affect? We could improve journeys by removing steps and getting users to retailers faster. We could list retailers higher up the page rather than hiding them within a collapsed accordion near the bottom of the page. These are a few of the ideas we came up with while doing discovery with the squad.

### Opportunities

Lots from an ideation workshop where we got everyone to show an example of how others are doing a good job of affiliate links.
