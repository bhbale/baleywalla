### Problem

More of a business problem... company had shift and find ways to diversify revenue. We already had an affiliate network and journey where users could clickthrough to retailers. Let's optimise this to increase affiliate revenue that supports or main revenue driver, subscriptions.

### Research

Is their any? Include competitor analysis? Stage in the research and buying journey that includes price and explain that it's out of our control if users choose to exclusively check prices on Which? or to check other sources which is another insight. 

A key insight is showing one or two retailers isn't enough for users. This is dependent on our tech being able to show more retailers so again, out of our control.

What do we have in control? The journeys to retailers, how we style pricing and retailers, and the components we own.

Lots from an ideation workshop where we got everyone to show an example of how others are doing a good job of affiliate links.
