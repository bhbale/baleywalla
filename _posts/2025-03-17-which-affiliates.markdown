### Summary

Focus on diversifying revenue outside of subscriptions → Affiliates seemed logical as it was in our remit → We tested a few good ideas → These ideas translated to an estimated £100k additional revenue per year

- My role
- Leading design within a product trio
- Planning and facilitating ideation sessions
- Competitor and affiliate business research
- Planning and writing A/B test plans
- Working closely with experimentation, data, and engineering teams

### Problem

After migrating key product review pages (consisting of listing, product, and compare templates), we could finally look to improve these pages for our users. At the time, the problem within the business was that subscriptions were dwindling and we coudn't rely on them alone.

As a squad, we looked to focus on affiliates to diversify revenue for the business. We just migrated ‘where to buy’ components on these key pages but not much had changed which put us in a good position to explore opportunities to optimise the affiliate journey and how we presented retailer links to users.

     <figcaption>The starting point - we had 'View retailers' links on product cards on various pages that would go to the product page  and anchor down to the 'Where to buy' accordion which was collapsed by default and near the bottom of the page</figcaption>

### Insights

From the research and buying journey, we already knew that users need to feel confident that they've found the best price before purchasing a product.

A running theme from previous research was that when users are given the option of only 1 or 2 retailers, this isn't enough for them to use our affiliate links. It's normal behaviour for users to look elsewhere i.e. Google Shopping to find more available retailers and pricing. We couldn't force our users to click our affiliate links which made this very constraining in what we could do.

### Opportunities

A workshop activity that was useful for us when it came to coming up with ideas to increase affiliate revenue was we gave each squad member homework to find an example of how other companies are doing affiliates well. This activity allowed squad members to get involved in competitor analysis as well as look for gaps in our existing affiliate experience.

Examples of some of the ideas included removing steps in the affiliate journey to get users to retailers faster, adding more prominence to the links, and having the links visible within view on certain pages.
