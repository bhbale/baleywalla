### Problem

With a leaky bucket issue within the subscription side of the business, our squad was tasked with how we could better retain members. A fundamental step in the research and buying journey is the ability to compare products at a glance. At the time, we weren't doing a good enough job in this area for members. 

As a squad, we identified 'compare' as a big opportunity to focus on where we could improve journeys for users and increase member engagement.

### Opportunities

Using HMWs from user insights, we came together as a squad to come up with ideas that we could test concepts quickly through A/B test experiments and where necessary, evaluative research. We prioritised the ideas based on how easily they would be to implement versus the impact it could potentially make to move retention metrics forward.

### Impact

After delivering a series of initiatives across multiple quarters, we saw a 33% YoY increase in engagement on the compare feature to our surprise.

By using user insight and connecting the work to business goals, our squad managed to tell a story of how essential it is to understand the research and buying journey of our users and how we can use these insights to help the business as well.
