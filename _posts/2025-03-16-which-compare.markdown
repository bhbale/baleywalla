### Summary

*TL;DR: Leaky bucket retention problem â†’ We did some things â†’ This somehow increased compare engagement 33% YoY â†’ A good story to tell* ðŸ˜Ž

With a leaky bucket subscription issue at the company, our squad was tasked with how we could better retain members. A key step in the research and buying journey is the ability to compare products at a glance. As a squad, we decided this area was a big opportunity to focus on where we could improve journeys for users and increase member engagement.

We completed multiple rounds of research and delivered a series of initiatives across multiple quarters. As a result of all the work and to our surprise, we saw a 33% YoY increase in engagement on the compare feature.

By using user insight and connecting the work to business goals, our squad managed to tell a story of how essential it is to understand the research and buying journey of our users and how we can use these insights to help the business as well.
