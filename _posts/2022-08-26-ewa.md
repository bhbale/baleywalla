### Summary

EatWorkArt is a workspace company offering creative studio spaces to individuals and businesses in the creative industry. They revitalise disused buildings, most notably Netil House, and transform them into creative communities across London.

My role on this project was solely visual design. The sitemap and wireframes were provided at the start of the project. These were repeatedly used as reference as I designed each custom page, template, and component.

I was fortunate to have a lot to work with including brand guidelines (logos, fonts, iconography, etc) by Studio Thomas and commissioned photography by a Netil House resident. Ensuring their digital space was in line with their brand was ultimately my role.
